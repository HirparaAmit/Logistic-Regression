# Logistic-Regression

In this project I create Logitic Regression using `scikit-learn` library. I covered all about Logistic Regression for example theories about it, mathematics behind it and how to code it. All these details are available in `.ipynb` file.

You just need to read `.ipynb` file.

I also created porject on Logistic Regression using `Pytorch`. So if you are intersted in that then go on :
